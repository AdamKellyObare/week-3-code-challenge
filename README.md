-Further more, in this project I was unable to configure the json server package due to the error below; 'Incorrect Password for adam'.
-The system is not processing the password therefore unable to allow the installation of the json server package, so I proceeded to tackling the project without the server.
-My local host is also unreachable. View this by clicking 'http://localhost:3000/characters'
